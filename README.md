 Communicate Data Findings


Data Set
 The dataset contains about 180K rows and 16 columns.The attributes include bike_id,gender,date of birth,start and end station id,latitude,longitude,station name etc.We remove unnecessary columns and change the data type of few attributes as a part of cleaning.Then we plot univariate,bivariate and multivariate plots.


The possible questions that can be framed
 
1.What are the most visited start and end stations?

2.How does the trend of rides change per hour,weekday and month?

3.Does the usage of bike share system depend on user type?

4.Does the above depend on gender of the user?
